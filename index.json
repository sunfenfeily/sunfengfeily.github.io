This paper designs a laboratory experiment with the framework of threshold public goods to simulate a strategy interaction scenario between children within a family. Based on the framework, this paper investigates the impacts of threshold level and endowment structure on the financial assistance provided by children to parents. Experimental results conclude that reduction in the exogenous cost of elderly care does not significantly affect the contribution level of children, but increases the probability of successfully reaching provision point remarkably; income heterogeneity between children significantly reduces investment level for the elderly service as well as the probability of successful supply. Moreover, this paper finds that there is a significant interaction effect between the elderly care cost and the income structure of the children. Compared to the family with homogeneous income, the decline in social care cost significantly reduces the supply level in children with a differentiated income structure. This effect is mainly achieved by priming potential social norms within the family. This study contributes to further understanding the complementary relationship between intergenerational support within family and social support from a third party in China, and helps explore the new elderly care scheme to improve the overall welfare of the nation.","tags":["Experimental Economics","Behavioral Economics","Threshold Public Goods Provision","Threshold level","Endowment structure","Interaction Effect","laboratory Experiment"],"title":"Pension Cost, Income Structure and Expenditure of Children's Pension Service","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anastasia Danilov","Dirk Sliwka"],"categories":null,"content":" Initial Paper  ","date":1613901600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613901600,"objectID":"4111c843232e882c6e47828a9b322b63","permalink":"https://sunfengfeily.github.io/talk/can-contracts-signal-social-norms/","publishdate":"2021-02-21T10:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/can-contracts-signal-social-norms/","section":"talk","summary":" Initial Paper  ","tags":["Field Experiment","Signal Information"],"title":"Can Contracts Signal Social Norms?--Experimental Evidence","type":"talk"},{"authors":["SUN Fengfei"],"categories":null,"content":"\r\rRelationship between Friendship and Gender in One Class\r\r","date":1596240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596240000,"objectID":"d1c8b89516c10b0131026bb89362c1c8","permalink":"https://sunfengfeily.github.io/publication/why-peers-matter/","publishdate":"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/why-peers-matter/","section":"publication","summary":"Social relationships affect behavior and performance. Based on the student friendship questionnaire surveys conducted in high school classes, this article examines the influence of network position of students within the class on their academic performance. Our research shows that the more popular students are in class, the better academic performance he or she might get in the exams. However, the number of friends a student filled out in the survey seemingly have little correlation with their scores. In addition, this paper tests the heterogeneous impact of social network on school performance and further attempts to analyze the relevant mechanisms. In this way, we provide a rigorous empirical study to prove that difference in the direction of social network relationships affects behavioral performance, which indicates that students can promote the accumulation of human capital from an early stage through constructing effective social network in their daily life.","tags":["Social Network Analysis","Individual Performance","Mechanism Analysis","Robust Check","IV Estimation"],"title":"Why Peers Matter: How Friendship Network Affects Students' Academic Performance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["SUN Fengfei"],"categories":null,"content":"In my senior year of college, my professor initiated an economic seminar involving different universities professors and students.

Once I lived in Beijing, I felt frustrated about my narrow horizon and low comprehensive abilities. There is a too wide information gap between metropolises and small towns. Coincidentally, some friends also encountered similar puzzles in university. We were from top universities of China (including Renmin univ., Tsinghua Univ., Fudan Univ., Zhejiang Univ.,Tianjin Univ., and Harbin Institute of Technology), but we were suffering from lack of confidence in our campus life.\n\rRoad and Mountains Near My Home\r\rThis experience got me thinking of high school students in my hometown, who lack opportunities to see the world outside of the mountains. They may experience similar dilemmas in their future, maybe we can help them pursue better education using our information, ability, and experiences. So, after preparation, we together founded The Dreamer.\n\r\rMemento Photo of Organization Foundation, 2018\r\rThe Dreamer is a non-profit organization aiming to support education development in my hometown.We recruited college student volunteers, and then taught high school students in the hometown. By now, we have implemented 8 sessions of supporting teaching activities during vacations. 300+ volunteers and 800+ students participated accumulatively.\n\r\rFourth Session of Dreamer, 2019\r\rAs the main leader of 5 sessions of activities, I spent almost all my summer vocations and winter vocations organizing and participating volunteering activities.Although busy and full of arrangements, I felt happy and content every time I saw faces of students in the classroom. \rGlimpse of Students in a Lecture, 2020\r\rGenerally, I arranged 4 kinds of volunteering activities to students:\n Courses teaching 9 disciplines from freshman year to senior year in high school. Lectures on expansion of horizons,including introduction of cutting-edge technology, computer operation skills, appreciation of poetry, and so on. Lectures on preparation experiences of College Entrance Examination and introduction of main majors and university life. Provision of self-learning guidance and supervision for students who don\u0026rsquo;t choose relative courses. \rSpeech on Opening Ceremony of Third Session of Dreamer, 2019\r\r  To provide activities efficiently, we have 4 main groups:\n Group of Publicity, responsible for managing social media online, distributing posters offline, and recruiting students. Group of Teaching Service, responsible for recruiting teaching volunteers, coordinating schedule and content of teaching in different grades, and arranging self-learning issues. Group of Lecture Service, responsible for arranging schedule, connecting lecturers, and preparing \u0026amp; summarizing the process of lectures. Group of Logistics Support, responsible for assisting matters in other groups when necessary. \rBasic Structure of Organization Management\r\r  As the main leader, I am responsible for coordinating volunteers in these groups and making important decisions including:\n Seeking sponsoring and assistance from local government and high schools for necessary subsides and sites support.
